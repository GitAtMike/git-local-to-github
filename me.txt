I grew up in Saint Peters Missouri where I attended Elementary school through College. I am currently majoring in a Computer Science degree. After I get my associates degree from SCC, I am going to Mizzou to get my bachelors. I am excited to continue this journey and can't wait to see where it will take me in the future.
